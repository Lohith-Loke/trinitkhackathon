# Idea
## people most opten use their names in mail address we levrage that to find their name 
## most cases it will be name+"digits"  we try to get name and search the name with 
## google site crawler to find the possible maches to our candidate 

### requirments 
1. shell/bash 
2. node 
3. puppeteer
4. python     

## limitations 
1. usage of non numeric chars in mail address 
2. using random mail address 
3. name on mail may have nothing to do with linkedin profile name 
4. though we get few profiles but its still far from being accurate results 

# proposals 
1. using AI to get names from maill 
2. use of other property like college name/workplace name etc to improve results 
# test run
